<h1>Virtual Notes For NVDA</h1>
<p>This add-on (Virtual Notes for NVDA) creates virtual notes that can be read by NVDA screen reader. Here are the available steps:<br />
<em> Select text;<br />
</em> Use shortcuts (all starting with the keys "NVDA + Alt").<br />
By pressing these keys combined with specific letters, you can perform the following actions:
* A: Add a new temporary note to memory;<br />
<em> J: Go to the previous note;<br />
</em> L: Go to the next note;<br />
<em> U: Read out the current note;<br />
</em> S: Replace the note in the current position (you need to select some text first);<br />
<em> D: Delete the note in the current position.<br />
If the current note contains multiple lines (like text copied from a text editor), use these additional letters:<br />
</em> I: Move to the previous line of the current note;<br />
<em> K: Move to the next line of the current note;<br />
</em> O: read out the current line of the current note.<br />
Note: The key positions mimic the arrow keys (I = up, L = right, K = down, and J = left).<br />
After using a shortcut, a specific sound will play to indicate the action performed.</p>
