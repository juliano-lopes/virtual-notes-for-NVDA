# Virtual Notes For NVDA  
This Addon creates virtual notes to be read by NVDA. The following steps are available:  
* Select a text;
* Use shortcuts (they all start with the keys "NVDA + Control + Shift).  

So, by pressing these keys, you can press the following letters further:  

* A to add a new temporary note to memory;
* J for previous note;
* K for next note;
* L for current note;
* M to replace note in current position.  

If the current note has more than one line (text copied from a text editor) use the following letters:  
* U for previous line of current note;
* O for next line of current note;
* P for current line of current note.
