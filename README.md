# Virtual Notes For NVDA  
This add-on (Virtual Notes for NVDA) creates virtual notes that can be read by NVDA screen reader. Here are the available steps:  
* Select text;  
* Use shortcuts to perform the following actions:
* NVDA + Alt + A: Add a new temporary note to memory;  
* NVDA + Alt + J: Go to the previous note;  
* NVDA + Alt + L: Go to the next note;  
* NVDA + Alt + U: Read out the current note;  
* NVDA + Alt + S: Replace the note in the current position (you need to select some text first);  
* NVDA + Alt + D: Delete the note in the current position.  
If the current note contains multiple lines (like text copied from a text editor), you can use these shortcuts:  
* NVDA + Alt + I: Move to the previous line of the current note;  
* NVDA + Alt + K: Move to the next line of the current note;  
* NVDA + Alt + O: read out the current line of the current note.  
Note: The key positions mimic the arrow keys (I = up, L = right, K = down, and J = left).  
After using a shortcut, a specific sound will play to indicate the action performed.
